### Steps to buy CloudCoins
1. LIST: The buyer will look at the coins that are for sale by calling the List Lockers For Sale command.
2. Send BTC: The buyer then sends BTC to the RAIDA's wallet for the amount of the locker they will purchase.
3. Wait: The buyer waits for the transaction to clear.
4. BUY: The buyer sends the transaction id and their BTC address to the RAIDA using the "Buy" service.
5. PEEK: The buyer now has the locker key with his coins. He callse the PEEK service.
6. REMOVE: The buyer then calls the REMOVE service and then has his coins.

## BUY LOCKER
Look at the steps that the buyer must make:  [Steps to buy CloudCoins](#steps-to-buy-cloudcoins)

After receiving the BUY LOCKER command the RAIDA will:
1. Check the Transaction Log to make sure this request has not been made before.
2. Look at the senders Bitcoin address and transaction number and check the blockchain explorer to see if the transaction is there. 
3. Check to see if there is a For Sale Locker with the correct coin type, price and total coins.
4. Make sure that the amount the buyer sent matches the amount in the locker (Ok to round up or down)
5. Change the ANs of the coins in the For Sale Locker to the PN specified by the Buyer.
6. Send a response back to the buyer. 
7. Calculate fees that the seller must pay. 
8. Order the Python server to send BTC minus the fee to CC Seller's crypto address.
9. Record the transaction.
10. Make a record of the fees collected.
11. Figure out how to get the fees to the RAIDA Admins. 


Note: The RAIDA must use the CD CD CD, $$ $$ $$ $$ and TO TO TO TO to find the "For Sale Locker" that the buyer wants to buy.
