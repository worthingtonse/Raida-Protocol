# Crossover services
Crossover services allows people to convert West tokens to other cryptos or from other cryptos to West Tokens.

RAIDA servers will have a special locker just for the West's conversion locker. Only the Treasure will be able to create and destroy tokens in this locker. The Treasury may also read the amount of coins in it. When the total coins are counted, the coins in the conversion account will need to be counted too. They will also need to be syncronized. While converting, coins will be taken out of this locker and placed into new lockers. Coins may also be taken out of user's lockers and placed in the conversion locker.

## REST Services Running on an Inforation Server
Some services do not need Data Supremacy and are located on tradition servers. They are acccessed using cutomary REST calls. These REST services are provided by a thrid part. The API can be found at [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16362858/UVXokDS6)

Method | Name | Description
---|---|---
GET | Get supported currencies | Returns a list of currencies that can be swapped
GET | Get rate | Shows the exchange rate the user must take. 
GET | Get transaction status | Tells the user what is happening with their transaction
GET | Get Transactions list | Shows a list of transactions that the user has performed
GET | Validate address | Allows the user to make sure the address is good

# Reserve Locker For Converting Crypto To West
The client calls this to tell the RAIDA that it will soon receive cryptocurrency so get a locker ready to put their West Tokens in. This service can be called after the crypto currency is sent to the RAIDA's wallet but that is risky. Someone else could claim that they sent the crypto and steal the CloudCoins. Therefor, the Reserve Locker command should be called before the client transfers crypto from their wallet to the RAIDA's wallet.

After receiving the Reserve Locker command the RAIDA will:
1. Create an empty locker with the locker code provided by the cleint.
2. Associates the locker code with the sender's crypto address.
3. Check the web API to see how much time that currencies are taking to complete. 
4. Set a timer based on the currency code or API.
5. If the times goes off before the locker has been used, the locker is deleted.
6. The locker is deleted after it West Tokens have been removed.

# Future Use:

To achieve your goal of requiring 16 out of 25 servers (where 16 hold slices of a Bitcoin wallet file and 9 hold parity information) to agree before sending Bitcoin, while leveraging your Bitcoin Core full node, you’re essentially looking to implement a secure, distributed multi-signature (multisig) wallet with a 16-of-25 threshold signature scheme. This setup ensures that no single server can control the funds, and the wallet can be reconstructed and transactions authorized only when 16 servers collaborate. Below, I’ll outline how to accomplish this, addressing the distributed wallet file, the parity information, and the integration with your Bitcoin Core node.
Understanding Your Setup
16 Servers with Wallet Slices: These servers hold fragments (or shares) of a Bitcoin wallet’s private key or seed, likely created using a secret-sharing scheme like Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS). The secret can be reconstructed only when 16 of these shares are combined.

9 Servers with Parity Information: These likely store redundancy data (e.g., error-correcting codes or additional shares) to ensure the wallet can be recovered even if some of the 16 servers fail, enhancing fault tolerance.

Bitcoin Core Server: This runs a full Bitcoin node, which can validate transactions, broadcast signed transactions, and potentially act as a coordinator for the wallet operations.

Goal: Require 16 servers to agree (provide their shares) to reconstruct the wallet’s private key or sign a transaction, ensuring funds can only be spent with this consensus.

## Solution: Implementing a 16-of-25 Threshold Multisig Wallet
To achieve this, you can use a combination of Shamir’s Secret Sharing (for distributing the wallet’s private key or seed) and a threshold signature scheme or multisig script to enforce the 16-of-25 agreement. Since you have 16 servers holding key shares and 9 providing parity, SSS is ideal for key distribution, and Bitcoin’s native multisig or a threshold signature protocol can enforce the signing requirement. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. Design the Wallet with Shamir’s Secret Sharing
Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) splits a secret (e.g., the wallet’s private key or seed phrase) into n shares, where any k shares (k ≤ n) can reconstruct the secret, but fewer than k reveal nothing. In your case:

n = 25 (16 key share servers + 9 parity servers).

k = 16 (threshold requiring 16 servers to reconstruct the secret).

## Steps:

Generate the Wallet:
Create a Bitcoin wallet using Bitcoin Core or an offline tool (e.g., bitcoin-cli createwallet). Extract the master private key or 12/24-word seed phrase (BIP-39).

For security, do this on an air-gapped machine to prevent key exposure.

## Split the Secret:
Use a Shamir’s Secret Sharing library to split the private key or seed into 25 shares, requiring 16 to reconstruct. Libraries include:
Python: secretsharing or ssss (Shamir’s Secret Sharing Split).

C++: libgfshare (for Shamir’s implementation).

JavaScript: secrets.js.

## Example (Python with secretsharing):
python

from secretsharing import SecretSharer
secret = "your_wallet_seed_or_private_key_hex"
shares = SecretSharer.split_secret(secret, 16, 25)  # 16-of-25 threshold

## Distribute the 25 shares:
ización: Distribute one share to each of the 25 servers (16 key share servers, 9 parity servers).

## Parity Information:
The 9 parity servers can store additional shares or error-correcting codes (e.g., using Reed-Solomon codes or extra SSS shares) to ensure fault tolerance. For SSS, the extra shares already provide redundancy, as any 16 of the 25 shares suffice. If using Reed-Solomon, libraries like pyfinite (Python) can generate parity data.

## Example: Assign shares 1–16 to the key share servers and 17–25 to parity servers. If up to 9 servers fail, the remaining 16 shares can still reconstruct the secret.

## Security Considerations:
Ensure shares are encrypted (e.g., AES-256 with a server-specific key) before storage.

Use secure communication (e.g., TLS) to transfer shares to servers.

Store shares in secure enclaves (e.g., SGX, TPM) or HSMs on each server if possible.

2. Implement a 16-of-25 Multisig or Threshold Signature Scheme
To enforce that 16 servers must agree to send Bitcoin, you can use one of two approaches: Bitcoin’s native multisig or a threshold signature scheme.
## Option A: Bitcoin Native Multisig (P2SH or P2WSH)
Bitcoin supports m-of-n multisig scripts, where m signatures from n public keys are required to spend funds. You can create a 16-of-25 multisig wallet.
## Steps:
Generate Key Pairs:
On each of the 25 servers, generate a Bitcoin key pair (public/private key) using Bitcoin Core’s RPC (bitcoin-cli getnewaddress and dumpprivkey) or a library like python-bitcoinlib.

Collect the 25 public keys.

## Create Multisig Address:
Use Bitcoin Core’s createmultisig RPC to create a 16-of-25 multisig address:
bash

bitcoin-cli createmultisig 16 '["pubkey1", "pubkey2", ..., "pubkey25"]'

This generates a P2SH (Pay-to-Script-Hash) or P2WSH (Pay-to-Witness-Script-Hash) address. Fund this address with Bitcoin.

## Distribute Private Key Shares:
Split the private key corresponding to one of the multisig key pairs (or a master key) using SSS, as described above, and distribute the 25 shares.

Alternatively, assign each server its own private key share, but this requires all 25 private keys to be securely generated and distributed initially.

## Sign Transactions:
To spend funds, collect 16 shares to reconstruct the private key (if using SSS for one key) or collect signatures from 16 servers (if each has its own key).

## Use Bitcoin Core’s signrawtransactionwithkey RPC to sign the transaction with the reconstructed key or individual keys:
bash

bitcoin-cli signrawtransactionwithkey 'hex_tx' '["privkey1", "privkey2", ...]'

Combine signatures (if using multiple keys) with combinesignatures and broadcast the transaction via sendrawtransaction on your Bitcoin Core node.

## Coordinator Role:
Your Bitcoin Core server can act as the coordinator, collecting shares or signatures from the 16 servers, constructing the transaction, and broadcasting it. Use secure APIs (e.g., REST over HTTPS) for servers to submit shares/signatures.

## Pros:
Native Bitcoin support, no external dependencies.

Compatible with Bitcoin Core’s RPC interface.

Transparent on-chain (multisig scripts are visible).

## Cons:
On-chain multisig scripts are larger, increasing transaction fees.

## Privacy: Multisig addresses reveal the 16-of-25 structure on-chain.

Collecting 16 signatures can be slow if servers are geographically dispersed.

## Option B: Threshold Signature Scheme
A threshold signature scheme (e.g., based on ECDSA or Schnorr signatures) allows 16 of 25 servers to collaboratively generate a single signature without reconstructing the private key on any single server. This is more complex but offers privacy and efficiency.
## Steps:
Choose a Threshold Signature Library:
## ECDSA-based:
tECDSA (Threshold ECDSA): Libraries like tss-lib (C++) or zengo-x/multi-party-ecdsa (Rust) support threshold ECDSA for Bitcoin.

Requires multi-party computation (MPC) to generate a shared key and sign.

## Schnorr-based (Bitcoin Taproot, post-2021):
Use MuSig2 (BIP-340 Schnorr signatures), which supports threshold signing.

Libraries: secp256k1-mw (C, part of Bitcoin Core’s libsecp256k1) or rust-musig2.

Schnorr signatures are more efficient and private (single signature on-chain).

## Generate a Shared Key:
Run a distributed key generation (DKG) protocol among the 25 servers to create a shared public key and 25 private key shares (using SSS internally). Libraries like tss-lib handle DKG.

The shared public key corresponds to a Taproot (P2TR) or P2WPKH address.

## Distribute Shares:
Assign each of the 25 servers a private key share from the DKG. The 9 parity servers can hold additional shares or error-correcting data, as with SSS.

## Sign Transactions:
To sign a transaction, 16 servers participate in an MPC protocol to generate a single ECDSA or Schnorr signature.

## Example (MuSig2):
Servers exchange nonces and partial signatures via secure channels.

A coordinator (your Bitcoin Core server) aggregates the partial signatures into a single signature.

Broadcast the transaction using Bitcoin Core’s sendrawtransaction.

## Integrate with Bitcoin Core:
Use Bitcoin Core to create the raw transaction (createrawtransaction) and broadcast the signed transaction. The coordinator can run a custom script to manage MPC communication.

## Pros:
Single signature on-chain (lower fees, better privacy).

Taproot/Schnorr signatures are compact and indistinguishable from regular transactions.

No need to reconstruct the private key, reducing risk.

## Cons:
Complex to implement (requires MPC expertise).

Higher computational overhead for signing.

Limited library support for production-ready threshold ECDSA/Schnorr.

3. Fault Tolerance with Parity Servers
Your 9 parity servers ensure the system tolerates up to 9 server failures. With SSS:
Any 16 of the 25 shares (from key share or parity servers) can reconstruct the secret or contribute to signing.

No additional coding is needed if using SSS for key shares, as the 25 shares already provide redundancy.

If using Reed-Solomon or similar, implement decoding logic (e.g., pyfinite) to recover missing shares from parity data before reconstructing the secret.

For multisig, parity servers can hold additional private keys or act as backups. For threshold signatures, they participate in DKG and signing as regular servers.
4. Coordinator Logic on Bitcoin Core Server
## Your Bitcoin Core server can orchestrate the process:
Transaction Creation:
Use createrawtransaction to build a transaction based on user input (e.g., recipient address, amount).

Estimate fees with estimatesmartfee.

## Collect Shares/Signatures:
Implement a secure API (e.g., Flask/Express with HTTPS) on the Bitcoin Core server to receive shares or signatures from the 16 servers.

Verify server authenticity (e.g., using client certificates or HMAC).

For SSS: Reconstruct the private key with 16 shares (e.g., SecretSharer.recover_secret(shares)).

For multisig: Collect 16 signatures and combine them.

For threshold: Coordinate MPC rounds (nonces, partial signatures) using the chosen library.

Sign and Broadcast:
Sign the transaction with reconstructed key or combined signatures (signrawtransactionwithkey).

Broadcast with sendrawtransaction.

## Security:
Run the coordinator in a secure enclave or isolated container.

Log server agreements for auditing without storing sensitive data.

5. Security and Practical Considerations
Network Security:
Use VPNs or Tor to secure communication between servers.

Implement rate-limiting and intrusion detection to prevent DoS attacks.

## Server Authentication:
Each server should have a unique key pair for signing share/signature submissions, verified by the coordinator.

## Backup and Recovery:
Regularly back up share metadata (not the shares themselves) to track which servers hold which shares.

Test recovery with 16 random shares to ensure correctness.

## Testing:
Use Bitcoin’s testnet to simulate the setup without risking real funds.

Simulate server failures to verify parity recovery.

## Scalability:
Optimize MPC for threshold signatures to reduce latency across global servers.

Cache block headers on the coordinator to speed up transaction verification.

## Legal/Compliance:
Ensure your distributed wallet complies with local regulations (e.g., KYC/AML for large transactions).

6. Recommended Approach
Given your setup (25 servers, Bitcoin Core node), I recommend:
Threshold Schnorr Signatures (MuSig2) for privacy and efficiency:
Use rust-musig2 or secp256k1-mw for Taproot-compatible signatures.

Split the shared private key with SSS (16-of-25) for distribution.

Assign shares to all 25 servers, with 9 acting as redundant nodes.

Why?
Single on-chain signature reduces fees and hides the 16-of-25 structure.

Leverages Taproot, supported by Bitcoin Core (post-2021).

SSS integrates naturally with your parity servers.

Fallback: If threshold signatures are too complex, use Bitcoin native multisig (P2WSH):
Simpler to implement with Bitcoin Core’s RPCs.

Trade-off: Higher fees and less privacy.

7. Example Workflow
User requests to send 0.1 BTC to bc1q....

Bitcoin Core server creates a raw transaction.

Coordinator pings 25 servers, collects shares/signatures from 16 (any combination of key share or parity servers).

## For SSS: Reconstruct private key and sign.
## For multisig: Combine 16 signatures.
## For threshold: Run MPC to generate one signature.

Bitcoin Core signs and broadcasts the transaction.

Notify servers of success/failure.

8. Tools and Resources
Bitcoin Core: Use v26.0+ for Taproot and RPC support (bitcoin-cli).

SSS Libraries:
Python: secretsharing (pip install secretsharing).

C: ssss (apt install ssss).

Threshold Signature Libraries:
MuSig2: rust-musig2 (GitHub: tower-rs/musig2).

tECDSA: zengo-x/multi-party-ecdsa (GitHub).

Parity: pyfinite for Reed-Solomon codes if not using SSS redundancy.

Networking: Use nginx + TLS or tor for secure server communication.

Integration with Exodus (Optional Context)
Since you previously asked about Exodus, note that Exodus is a lightweight wallet and doesn’t support this level of distributed multisig or custom node integration natively. Your setup is far more advanced, resembling institutional-grade custody solutions (e.g., Fireblocks, BitGo). You’re better off building a custom solution with Bitcoin Core and the tools above, as Exodus lacks the flexibility to interface with your 25-server setup or enforce a 16-of-25 threshold.
Conclusion
To ensure Bitcoin is sent only after 16 of your 25 servers agree, use Shamir’s Secret Sharing to split a wallet’s private key into 25 shares (16-of-25 threshold), with 16 key share servers and 9 parity servers providing redundancy. Implement a threshold Schnorr signature scheme (MuSig2) for efficient, private signing, or fall back to Bitcoin’s native 16-of-25 multisig for simplicity. Your Bitcoin Core server can coordinate transaction creation, collect shares/signatures, and broadcast transactions. Use open-source libraries like rust-musig2 or secretsharing, secure all communications, and test on testnet. This setup ensures high security, fault tolerance, and alignment with your distributed infrastructure.
